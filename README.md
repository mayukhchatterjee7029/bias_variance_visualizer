# 📈 Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that visualizes the **bias-variance tradeoff** in supervised learning using synthetic data and polynomial regression. It helps understand model underfitting, overfitting, and how model complexity affects training vs validation error.
